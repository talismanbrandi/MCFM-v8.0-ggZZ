These are configuration files for the different runs with different top masses in the triangle loop
HHTOP = 1 TeV
HTOP = 500 GeV
TOP = 172 GeV

For each top mass line 43 of src/ZZ/getggHZZamps.f needs to be modified for the top mass to be used in the triangle diagram. The configuration files in HHTOP, HTOP and TOP are the same.
